# GitHub Guide for QuantumField-AI-Bridge Researchers

This guide provides essential information for researchers participating in the QuantumField-AI-Bridge project using GitHub. Whether you're familiar with version control or new to collaborative coding platforms, this document will help you contribute effectively to our interdisciplinary research.

## Getting Started

### 1. Setting Up Your GitHub Account

1. **Create a GitHub account** at [github.com](https://github.com/) if you don't already have one
2. **Set up two-factor authentication** for added security
3. **Install Git** on your local machine from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. **Configure Git** with your name and email:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@institution.edu"
   ```

### 2. Accessing the Project Repository

1. Request access to the repository by contacting the project administrator
2. Once granted access, clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sika7/QuantumField-AI-Bridge.git
   cd QuantumField-AI-Bridge
   ```

## Repository Structure

The repository follows the structure outlined in our [project_structure.md](./project_structure.md) document, with key directories including:

- `/docs/` - Documentation files
- `/research/` - Research notes and literature reviews
- `/prototypes/` - Implementation code for prototype models
- `/community/` - Community and collaboration resources
- `/papers/` - Draft papers and publication materials

## Workflow for Researchers

### Daily Work Routine

1. **Sync with the latest changes** before starting work:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a branch** for your specific task:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** to the relevant files

4. **Commit your changes** with descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add analysis of quantum field vibration patterns in 2D materials"
   ```

5. **Push your branch** to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub for review

### Collaborative Best Practices

1. **Keep commits focused** on single logical changes
2. **Write descriptive commit messages** that explain why the change was made
3. **Reference relevant issues** using the # symbol (e.g., "Addresses #42")
4. **Request reviews** from team members with relevant expertise
5. **Discuss changes** within PR comments rather than external channels when possible

## Working with Research Content

### Managing Research Documents

- Store literature reviews and research notes in `/research/` with descriptive filenames
- Use Markdown (.md) format for text-based research documents
- Include proper citations using standard academic formats
- Link to related documents using relative paths

### Handling Data and Results

- Store small datasets directly in the repository
- For large datasets, store metadata files with links to external storage
- Document data sources, collection methods, and processing steps
- Include visualization scripts and notebooks in the appropriate directories

### Code and Computational Experiments

- Place prototype code in the `/prototypes/` directory
- Include clear documentation and requirements in each code directory
- Use Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and share them in the repository
- Document computational environments using requirements.txt or environment.yml files

## Common GitHub Tasks for Researchers

### Checking Repository Status

```bash
git status  # Shows the current status of your working directory
```

### Viewing Commit History

```bash
git log  # View detailed commit history
git log --oneline  # View simplified commit history
```

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

1. When a conflict occurs, Git will mark the conflicted areas in the affected files
2. Open the files and look for sections marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`
3. Edit the files to resolve the conflicts
4. Add the resolved files and complete the merge:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts in quantum AI module description"
   ```

### Reverting Changes

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>  # Creates a new commit that undoes changes
```

## Integrating with Scientific Workflows

### LaTeX Integration

- Store LaTeX source files in the `/papers/` directory
- Use Git to track changes to LaTeX documents
- Consider using Git LaTeX hooks or pre-commit tools for consistent formatting

### Computational Notebooks

- Store Jupyter notebooks in appropriate subdirectories based on their purpose
- Clear notebook outputs before committing unless the outputs are essential
- Consider using tools like nbdime for better notebook diffing and merging

### References and Citations

- Store bibliography files (.bib) in the repository for consistent citation
- Use reference management tools that integrate with Git workflows
- Document the citation style used for the project

## Guidelines for Interdisciplinary Collaboration

As an interdisciplinary project bridging quantum physics, materials science, and AI, clear communication is essential:

1. **Define domain-specific terminology** in your documentation
2. **Explain the relevance** of your contributions to different disciplines
3. **Be receptive to questions** from collaborators with different backgrounds
4. **Review contributions** across disciplinary boundaries to ensure consistency

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues or have questions:

1. Check the GitHub documentation at [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/)
2. Ask questions in the project's Issues section with the "question" label
3. Contact the repository maintainers for project-specific questions
